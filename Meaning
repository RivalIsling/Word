  <h3><i>Mountain</i></h3>
  The low lands call<br>
I am tempred to answer<br>
They are offering me a free dwelling<br>
Without having to conquer<br>
  
<br>The massive mountain makes its move<br>
Beckoning me to ascend<br>
A much more difficult path<br>
To get up the slippery bend<br>

<br>I cannot choose both<br>
I have a choice to make<br>
I must be wise<br>
This will determine my fate<br>

<br>I choose, I choose the mountain<br>
With all its stress and strain<br>
Because only by climbing<br>
Can I rise above the plain<br>

<br>I choose the mountain<br>
And I will never stop climbing<br>
I choose the mountain<br>
And I shall forever be ascending<br>

<br>I choose the mountain<br>
